# SLAM_Learning
A personal learning journey into SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) and autonomous navigation using ROS2 and TurtleBot3 for RoboCup@Work 2026.

This is my learning repository for understanding Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), ROS2, and autonomous navigation using TurtleBot3 simulation. This repo tracks my progress as I prepare for RoboCup@Work 2026 with a focus on real-world robotics.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered
- SLAM fundamentals and types
- ROS2 + Docker setup
- Simulation in Gazebo with TurtleBot3
- Nav2 stack exploration
- TF2 and coordinate frames

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure
- `docs/`: Theory notes and screenshots
- `src/`: Technical breakdowns and code notes
- `docker/`: Docker setup and environment instructions

## ðŸ§  My Goal:
To master the SLAM & Navigation stack to build industrial-grade robots for real-world environments.
