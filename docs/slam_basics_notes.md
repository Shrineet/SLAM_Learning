# SLAM Basics

**What is SLAM?**
SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) is the process where a robot builds a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously tracking its own location within that map.

**Why SLAM matters:**
- Enables robots to navigate in unknown environments
- Used in self-driving cars, drones, warehouse robots

**Types of SLAM:**
- Visual SLAM
- LIDAR SLAM
- Sensor Fusion

**Common Algorithms:**
- EKF-SLAM (Extended Kalman Filter)
- Graph-SLAM
- ORB-SLAM (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)

**Real-world Application:**
Used in RoboCup@Work to let robots move in industrial environments without human help.
